# Code Quiz

## Description
This is a timer-based application of a code quiz with multiple-choice questions. A quiz can have any number of questions with any number of multiple or truthy choices. The time limit for the quiz is 10 seconds multiplied by the number of questions. A wrong answer subtracts 10 seconds off the time and a correct answer adds 10. The top 5 high scores are viewable. Scores are stored in `localStorage` of the browser and can be cleared.
